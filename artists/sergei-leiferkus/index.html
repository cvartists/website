	<h1>Sergei Leiferkus</h1>
	<p></p>
	<img src="sl2.jpg" align="left"></img>Sergei Leiferkus is one of the most renowned baritone voices in the opera world. His ability to portray both noble and evil characters, vocally and theatrically, has naturally led him to master roles such as Scarpia, Jago, Rangoni, Telramund, and Alberich.
	<p>He has been a regular guest at some of the world’s leading opera houses, including: the Royal Opera House Covent Garden; the Vienna State Opera; the Bastille in Paris; La Scala in Milan; the Berlin State Opera; San Francisco Opera; the Metropolitan Opera in New York; and the Teatro Colòn in Buenos Aires. He has also appeared at the opera festivals of Bregenz, Salzburg, and Glyndebourne.</p>
	<p>Highlights of past seasons include Filip Filippovich Preobrazhensky, a role which was composed especially for him, in Raskatov’s A Dog’s Heart at the Opéra Lyon, as well as the Forester in The Cunning Little Vixen at the Glyndebourne Festival. More recently, he has sung the role of the Baron in the Rachmaninoff Troika at La monnaie in Brussels; Schigolch in a revival of Lulu at the Hamburg State Opera; and Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky/Matveyev in War and Peace at the Bavarian State Opera.</p>
	<p>Most notable among his numerous concert appearances are his début as Boris Godunov in Saint Petersburg in 2014; an evening of Russian music by Raskatov, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Mussorgsky in London with the LPO and Vladimir Jurowski (2011); Shostakovich’s 13th Symphony (Babi Yar) in Vladivostok and Francesca di Rimini in Darmstadt. More recently, he has sung Songs and Dances of Death with BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Martyn Brabbins, and Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve with the RSB Berlin and Vladimir Jurowski.</p>
	<p>He has worked with orchestras such as the London Symphony, Montreal Symphony, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic, under the baton of conductors such as Claudio Abbado, Valery Gergiev, Lorin Maazel, James Levine, Bernard Haitink, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Seiji Ozawa, Kent Nagano, Leonard Slatkin, Kurt Masur, and Sir Georg Solti.</p>
